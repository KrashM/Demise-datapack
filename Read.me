1. When you load the datapack you would be given a sign, which when clicked you get moved into the alive team by having 50 diamonds in your inventory.
2. For Demise to be started there MUST be at least 2 players in the alive team. After that a trigger scoreboard would be made available to start the game. (/trigger start)
3. Last one left alive wins all the prize.
4. If you uninstall before the game has started all the diamonds are returned to the players who have signed.
5. To get the sign and install all needed scoreboards and teams you can use the load or init function, both should work.
6. Enjoy everyone!
